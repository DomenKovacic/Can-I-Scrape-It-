# Can I Scrape It: A Web Scraping Legal Assistant

## Overview
"Can I Scrape It" is an innovative web application designed to provide clarity and guidance on the legal aspects of web scraping. It serves as a tool for developers, data analysts, and researchers to quickly determine whether a website can be scraped, based on the directives found in its `robots.txt` file. This project combines Python's powerful backend capabilities with a user-friendly interface to simplify the often-complex process of interpreting web scraping permissions.

## Features
- **URL Submission**: Users can input any website URL to check its web scraping status.
- **Robots.txt Fetching and Parsing**: The application retrieves and parses the `robots.txt` file of the submitted URL, providing insights into the permissions set by the website owner.
- **Legality Indicator**: It offers a clear indication of whether the website explicitly allows or disallows scraping, based on the information in the `robots.txt`.
- **Segmented Permissions**: Detailed breakdown of which parts of the website can be scraped, as per the `robots.txt` directives.
- **Caching Mechanism**: Implements caching for frequently requested websites to enhance performance.
- **User Privacy and Compliance**: Ensures user privacy and compliance with data protection laws.

## Technologies
- **Backend**: Python with Flask/Django for handling server-side logic.
- **Frontend**: Simple yet effective interface for user interactions.
- **Libraries**: Utilizes Python libraries such as `requests` for web requests and other parsing tools for interpreting `robots.txt` content.

## Legal Disclaimer
This tool provides guidance based on the `robots.txt` file and does not offer legal advice. Users are encouraged to consider additional legal aspects, including the website's terms of service and local/international laws, before proceeding with web scraping.
